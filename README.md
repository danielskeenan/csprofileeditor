CS Profile Editor
=================

Fixture profile editor for ETC ColorSource Console.

This program is not sponsored by and has no affiliation with ETC. I found the official editor clunky and difficult to
use, so I authored this alternative.

Installation
------------

This program requires continuous access to certain data files distributed with
the [official editor](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Consoles/ColorSource/Software.aspx). On Windows, install the
program. On Mac, use [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) to extract the files from the installer and place them
somewhere on your system. Do not remove these files as long as you continue to use this program.
